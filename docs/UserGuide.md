## Features

### Input of data: `input`

Stores the data to be processed by modules.

Format: `input <data>`

> :information_source: `data` will be treated as text.

Examples:

- `input SGVsbG9Xb3JsZA==` Enter base64-encoded data.
- <code>input  hello world </code> Enter plain text as data.

> :exclamation: Note that the program will consider all characters as `data` following the first space character in the input command. Observe the leading and trailing whitespaces in the result of the second command in the above screenshot.

> :exclamation: Non-printable characters (e.g. null characters) may not be correctly displayed and could potentially scramble the user interface.

### List available modules: `list`

Shows a list of all available modules.

Format: `list`

![carbon(8).png](images/carbon(8).png)

### Selection of module: `select`

Selects a module and processes the data accordingly. Subsequent selection of modules will process the transformed data output from the previous module.

Format: `select <moduleName>`

`moduleName` is the name of an available module supported by the program.

Examples:

- `select base64decode` Decode the base64 encoded data.
- `select hexencode` Encode the data into hexadecimal format.
