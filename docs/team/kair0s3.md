# Project Portfolio Page - Decodex

## Overview
This is a student project for Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming (CS2113/T). And, I am **Sim Tian Boon**, one of the contributors of `Decodex`.

## Project Name: `Decodex`
`Decodex` is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for Capture-The-Flag (CTF) players to quickly transform data from one format to another easily and intuitively.

## Summary of Contributions
Below are my contributions to the `Decodex`

*Note that the PR links below are the more notable ones - easier to find.*

Features/Functionalities

1. Added `Parser` functionality to parse user inputs (For non-recipe commands) ([#53](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/53), [#72](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/72/files))
    - Functionality - Performs the parsing of user input to corresponding command.
    - Justification - Helps to parse user input so that `Decodex` can run the correct command that users expect.

2. Added the ability to show current data ([#274](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/274))
    - Feature - Shows the user the current data that they have. By default, this current data will be your original data if no modules has been run on it.
    - Justification - Allows user to keep track of the current data they are working on, and also credits to @alwinangys for the [suggestion](https://github.com/alwinangys/ped/issues/4).

3. Added Base64 Modules (Base64 Encoder and Decoder) ([#35](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/35))
    - Feature - Allows users to use these modules to encode/decode using base64 formats.
    - Justification - This is one of the more common encoding formats that appear in CTFs.

4. Added ability to load recipes from files on start up ([#208](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/208/))
    - Functionality - Performs the loading of saved recipe files upon run of `Decodex`.
    - Justification - Allows users to load previously saved recipes and provides convenience.

5. Added ability to save recipe into file, and delete the recipe file ([#208](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/208/))
    - Functionality - Saves (Auto) the recipe into a file named `recipeName.txt` and stores it in the `recipe/` directory. The auto-deletion of the recipe file happens when user deletes the recipe on `Decodex`.
    - Justification - Allows users to save recipes into file and delete without having to manually do it.

## Enhancements to Existing Features
- Refactored and improved Coding Standards
    - `Storage` - Remove the magic literals [#280](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/280) and removed dead code [#251](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/251/files)
    - `Decodex` - Grouped a code fragment together and made the while loop less complex/more readable [#280](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/280)
- Assertion for `Parser` - [#99](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/99/files)
- Logging for `Decodex.class` - [#96](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/96)
- Wrote JUnit Test for Base64 Modules and Parser - [#35](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/35), [#72](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/72/), [#91](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/91)
- Attempted to standardize coding styles/documentation - [#47](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/47), [#147](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/147)
    - I learnt that this is probably one of the hardest thing to do since everyone has their own style of codes and the way they describe/explain things.
- JavaDocs for `Decodex` and `Storage` - Some notable ones ([#280](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/280))
- Bug Fixes - [#274](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/274), [#286](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/pull/286)
